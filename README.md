# RT-WiFi

## What is This
This the modified version of RT-WiFi for my Masters research.

The RT-WiFi is an architecture to handle real-time communication in infrastructured IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) networks, designed to work in dense industrial environment with multiple networks using the same WiFi channel.

It uses a technique that combines a TDMA scheduling with the increasing of the packet priority to provide a lower packet loss, even with alien networks interferences.
